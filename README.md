Rules of state:
1) only useable with class components (can be used with funtional components using hooks system)
2) 'state' is a js object that contains data relavent to a singular component 
3) Updating a 'state' on a component causes the component to almost instantly render
4) state must be initialized when a component is created
5) state can only be updated using the function 'setState'
